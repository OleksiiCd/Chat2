# Chat2
HI! This is online chat, based on NodeJS + SocketIo + ExpressJS in backend and ReactJS in front-end. 
If you download it, you should open 2 terminals and split it.
After that, in first one print "cd server", in second one "cd client" and "npm start" in both.
In browser you will see the main page. Duplicate it.
Enter your nickname and name of the room in both pages. (name room shoud be the same)
Click Join.
Have fun! 
Thanks for your attention!
